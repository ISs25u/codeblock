# v1.0.0 goals

- [x] User associated filesystem to store programs
- [x] Allow to set drone's file with in-game interface + remember last program started
- [x] Control drone operating speed

- [ ] Blockly web-based editor

# next intermediate version goals

- [ ] move allowed blocks to config + procedurally generate them
- [x] create examples folder and generate them

# maybe

- [ ] option to set drone default block to place

- [ ] make mod configurable (see https://github.com/AntumMT/mod-hovercraft/)
- [ ] fix place() in non-loaded chunks
    - minetest.emerge_area(pos1, pos2, [callback], [param])
    - minetest.get_node_or_nil(pos) (if unloaded)
    - minetest.emerge_area(pos1, pos2, [callback], [param]) (does not trigger emerge)
    - minetest.compare_block_status(pos, condition)
- [ ] fix color(v,m,M) function (or remove)
- [ ] rebuild construction when re-running code (save previous area)
